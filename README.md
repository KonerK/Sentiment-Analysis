# Sentiment Analysis

## The Project
The following project was completed as part of the NLP (Natural Language Processing) module for final-year undergraduates studying Computer Science at the University of Bath, which received a mark of 78%. 

Sentiment analysis is the process of analysing text to determine its emotional tone (positive or negative). In this project, we explore a typical pipeline for a machine learning project, particularly an NLP one, through exploring a couple models we can use for sentiment analysis (Naive Bayes, Logisitc Regression, Support Vector Machines). Specifically, we explore the effectiveness of each model in classifying tone of a move review (postive vs negative), with each model trained and tested using the Large Movie Review Dataset provided by Standford. This dataset contains 1000s of movie reviews collected from IMDb.
